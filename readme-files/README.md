"# ssdsdsdsdsd\n\n## Description\n\nProvide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:\n\n- What was your motivation?\n- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not \"Because it was a homework assignment.\")\n- What problem does it solve?\n- What did you learn?\n\n## Table of Contents (Optional)\n\nIf your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Credits](#credits)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Installation\n\nWhat are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.\n\n## Usage\n\nProvide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.\n\nTo add a screenshot, create an assets/image folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:\n\n    md\n    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)\n    \n\n## Credits\n\nList your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.\n\nIf you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.\n\nIf you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.\n\n## License\n\nThe last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).\n\n---\n\nüèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.\n\n## Badges\n\n![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)\n\nBadges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.\n\n## Features\n\nIf your project has a lot of features, list them here.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nIf you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.\n\n## Tests\n\nGo the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.\n  \n"
